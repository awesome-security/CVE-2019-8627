# CVE-2019-null
a  kernel information leak on macOS&lt;= 10.14.4
I don't know why APPLE no give me CVE.may be they forgot it.

===============================



How reproudce:
1. turn on firewall 
2. run the poc as root
3. disconnect Belkin USB-C LAN network and then connect the  Belkin USB-C LAN network .after these operations you will get the leaded data.  or if you don't have USB-C LAN network  you can try close the firewall and turn on the firewall . by these steps ,you will see the leaked  kernel data.NOTE: with the operation just speed up to get the leaked data. you can do nothing just wait for the result.
